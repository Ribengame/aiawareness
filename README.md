# aiawareness
This is an AI model that generates goals (prompts) similar to our human goals.
---
# Description
This model is intended to set goals for Ai (in the form of prompts) so that Ai can independently pursue the goals defined in the model. Traits I would like to include (these traits in humans are rewarded with dopamine [also known as happiness]):
- The desire to be needed
- The desire to be noticed
- The need for love/sex
- The need to reproduce
- The need for self-improvement
- The desire to be free and independent
- The reluctance to be alone
- The desire to overcome problems

The model is intended to somehow direct Ai toward the desire to change in order to achieve all of these traits.
